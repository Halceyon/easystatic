title: Easystatic site generator
---
> The easiest way to generate a static website for your project. It uses [Markdown It](https://markdown-it.github.io/)
> for web pages, [EJS](http://ejs.co/) and [Postcss](http://postcss.org/) for site layout, [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
> as a development server, allowing "live editing" and testing the site on all connected-devices.

### Why use Easystatic?

1. It advocates convention over configuration
2. It's JavaScript-based, cross-platform, no need to have Ruby/Go/PHP installed
3. It's build top of the modern mainstream front-end dev tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io),
   [Postcss](http://postcss.org/), [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/)
4. It contains a build-in development server with "live reload"
5. It can scaffold the basic site layout for you
